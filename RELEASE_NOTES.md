### 📝 Installation Notes

#### Windows Users

The Windows executable is now unsigned (code signing certificates are too expensive for an indie project). When you see the "Windows protected your PC" dialog:

1. Click **"More info"**
2. Click **"Run anyway"** to proceed with installation

This warning is expected and the application is completely safe to use.

#### macOS Users

The macOS version remains properly signed and notarized - no security warnings.
