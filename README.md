## Directory structure

```plaintext
.
└── ./src/
    ├── ./src/assets/
    │   └── ./src/assets/fonts/
    ├── ./src/components/
    │   └── ./src/components/ui/
    ├── ./src/helpers/
    │   └── ./src/helpers/ipc/
    ├── ./src/layout/
    ├── ./src/lib/
    ├── ./src/pages/
    ├── ./src/stories/
    ├── ./src/style/
    └── ./src/tests/
```

- `src/`: Main directory
  - `assets/`: Store assets like images, fonts, etc.
  - `components/`: Store UI components
    - `ui/`: Store Shadcn UI components (this is the default direcotry used by Shadcn UI)
  - `helpers/`: Store IPC related functions to be called in the renderer process
    - `ipc/`: Directory to store IPC context and listener functions
      - Some implementations are already done, like `theme` and `window` for the custom title bar
  - `layout/`: Directory to store layout components
  - `lib/`: Store libraries and other utilities
  - `pages/`: Store app's pages
  - `stories/`: Store Storybook stories
  - `style/`: Store global styles
  - `tests/`: Store tests (from Jest and Playwright)

## Development Scripts

### Revert to Tag Script

Located in `scripts/revert-to-tag.sh`, this script allows you to safely revert the main branch to a specific tag's state without rewriting git history.

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/revert-to-tag.sh <tag_name>
```

For example:
```bash
./scripts/revert-to-tag.sh v1.0.69
```

The script will:
1. Check if the tag exists
2. Switch to main branch and update it
3. Revert all changes after the specified tag
4. Create a commit with the reversion
5. Push the changes to the remote repository

## NPM script

To run any of those scripts:

```bash
npm run <script>
```

- `start`: Start the app in development mode
- `package`: Package your application into a platform-specific executable bundle and put the result in a folder.
- `make`: Generate platform-specific distributables (e.g. .exe, .dmg, etc) of your application for distribution.
- `publish`: Electron Forge's way of taking the artifacts generated by the `make` command and sending them to a service somewhere for you to distribute or use as updates.
- `prett`: Run Prettier to format the code
- `storybook`: Start Storybook
- `build-storybook`: Run the Storybook's build command
- `test`: Run the default unit-test script (Jest)
- `test:watch`: Run the default unit-test script in watch mode (Jest)
- `test:unit`: Run the Jest tests
- `test:e2e`: Run the Playwright tests
- `test:all`: Run all tests (Jest and Playwright)

The test scripts involving Playwright require the app be builded before running the tests. So, before run the tests, run the `package`, `make` or `publish` script.

## Development

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hunght/iTracksy.git
```


2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the app

```bash
npm run start
```

## Releasing New Versions

iTracksy uses GitHub Actions for automated releases. To publish a new version:

1. Run one of the following commands:
   ```bash
   npm run release         # Increment patch version (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
   npm run release minor   # Increment minor version (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
   npm run release major   # Increment major version (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
   npm run release 1.2.3   # Set specific version
   ```

2. The release script will:
   - Update version in package.json
   - Create a git commit with the version change
   - Create and push a git tag
   - Push changes to main branch

3. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build the application
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Upload the built artifacts

## Troubleshooting

### Native Modules in Production Build

When building the application for production, you might encounter issues with native modules like `serialport`. This is handled in the project using the `packageAfterPrune` configuration in `forge.config.ts`. This configuration ensures that native modules are properly rebuilt for production.

Reference: [SerialPort Issue #2464](https://github.com/serialport/node-serialport/issues/2464)
