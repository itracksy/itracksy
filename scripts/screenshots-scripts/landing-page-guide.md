# iTracksy Landing Page Guide

This guide explains how to build the landing page for iTracksy using the comprehensive feature screenshots generated by our automated process.

## Overview

The landing page showcases ALL key features of iTracksy through high-quality screenshots that demonstrate the app's complete functionality. Our automated screenshot process captures the following comprehensive set of features:

### Core Productivity Features

1. **Activity Tracking** - Focus session interface and time tracking

## Screenshot Generation Process

The screenshots are automatically generated using Playwright tests, which simulate user interaction with the app. The process:

1. Builds the app in development mode
2. Opens each feature page systematically
3. Takes full-page screenshots with proper loading waits
4. Moves them to the web project's public directory

### Running Screenshot Generation

You can generate screenshots using these npm commands:

```bash
# Generate all screenshots (recommended)
npm run screenshots

# Generate with verbose output for debugging
npm run screenshots:verbose

# Quick generation (skip build step)
npm run screenshots:quick
```

Or run the script directly:

```bash
# Basic generation
./scripts/screenshots-scripts/generate-screenshots.sh

# With options
./scripts/screenshots-scripts/generate-screenshots.sh --verbose
./scripts/screenshots-scripts/generate-screenshots.sh --skip-build
./scripts/screenshots-scripts/generate-screenshots.sh --help
```

The screenshots are generated in `/Users/owner/source/itracksy.com/itracksy-web/public/screenshots/`.

## Building the Landing Page

### 1. Page Structure

The landing page should have the following structure:

- Hero section with a tagline and call-to-action
- Features section (using screenshots)
- Benefits section
- Testimonials (if available)
- Pricing (if applicable)
- Download/Call-to-action

### 2. Feature Section Implementation

For each feature, create a section that includes:

```html
<section class="feature">
  <div class="feature-content">
    <h2>[Feature Name]</h2>
    <p>[Feature Description]</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[Benefit 1]</li>
      <li>[Benefit 2]</li>
      <li>[Benefit 3]</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-image">
    <img src="/screenshots/[screenshot-name].png" alt="[Feature Name] in iTracksy" loading="lazy" />
  </div>
</section>
```

### 3. Screenshot Usage Guidelines

- Use the following paths for the screenshots:

  - `/screenshots/activity-tracking.png`
  - `/screenshots/project-management.png`
  - `/screenshots/time-analytics.png`
  - `/screenshots/activity-classification.png`
  - `/screenshots/rule-classification.png`

- For responsive design:

  - On mobile: Show a smaller version or crop the most important part
  - On tablet: Show a medium-sized version with important details
  - On desktop: Show the full screenshot with high resolution

- Add subtle animations (optional):
  - Fade-in effect when scrolling to the section
  - Hover effect that slightly enlarges the image
  - Subtle shadow effect to make screenshots "pop"

### 4. Feature Descriptions

Use these descriptions for each feature:

#### Activity Tracking

Track your work sessions effortlessly. iTracksy automatically captures your activities, helping you understand where your time goes without manual input.

#### Project Management

Organize tasks with an intuitive kanban board. Drag and drop cards between columns to update status and keep your projects moving forward.

#### Time Analytics

#### Activity Classification

#### Rule-Based Classification

Customize how activities are categorized. Create rules to automatically classify your work based on application names, websites, or custom patterns.

## Updating Screenshots

To update the screenshots:

1. Make changes to the app's UI as needed
2. Run `./scripts/generate-screenshots.sh` from the iTracksy app directory
3. The latest screenshots will automatically be copied to the web project

## Best Practices

- Keep text concise and benefit-focused
- Alternate left and right positioning of text/images for visual interest
- Use consistent spacing between sections
- Optimize images for web (consider using WebP format alongside PNG)
- Ensure the page loads quickly by deferring off-screen image loading
